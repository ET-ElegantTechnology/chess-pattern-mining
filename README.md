# Chess Data Mining Project

## Project Overview
This project explores chess data to uncover patterns in game outcomes, openings, and player performance. It demonstrates data preprocessing, pattern mining, and visualization skills.

## Objectives
- Analyze chess game outcomes and player statistics.
- Identify frequent patterns in openings using FP-growth.
- Visualize relationships between ECO codes, game results, and player ratings.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming chess tournament data.
- **Pattern Mining:** Using FP-growth to discover frequent opening patterns.
- **Visualization:** Bar plots, scatter plots, and interactive dashboards.
- **Database Management:** SQLite integration for data warehousing and data cubes.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, mlxtend, Dash)
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Frequent pattern mining (FP-growth)
- Data visualization and storytelling
- SQL and database management
- Git for version control
